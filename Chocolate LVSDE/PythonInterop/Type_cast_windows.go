/*
	Named "Chocolate LVSDE", this project (including but not limited to this file) is an implementation of LVSDE dimensionality reduction technique written in Go programming language (majority of the code volume) and Python programming language, sometimes interoperating through C programming language interface of Go as the intermediate language interface, in addition to some codes written in Javascript, CSS and HTML.

	The github repository for this project is designated at https://github.com/farshad-barahimi-academic-codes/chocolate-lvsde
