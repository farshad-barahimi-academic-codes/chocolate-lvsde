# Chocolate LVSDE

This project is an implementation of LVSDE dimensionality reduction technique written in Go programming language (majority of the code volume) and Python programming language, sometimes interoperating through C programming language interface of Go as the intermediate language interface, in addition to some codes written in Javascript, CSS and HTML.

Farshad Barahimi is the only code author for this project including but not limited to this file. All codes in this project including but not limited to this file are written by Farshad Barahimi.

LVSDE stands for Layered Vertex Splitting Data Embedding.
